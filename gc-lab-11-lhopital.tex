{\aufgabe} A farmer has 2400ft of fencing and wants to fence off a
rectangular field that borders a straight river. She needs no fence
along the river. What are the dimensions of the field that has the
largest area?

{\aufgabe} A cylindrical can is to be made to hold one litre of oil.
Find the dimensions that wil minimize the cost of the metal to
manufacture the can.

{\aufgabe} Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be
inscribed in a semicircle of radius $r$.

{\aufgabe} A cone with height $h$ and radius $r$ is inscribed in a
larger cone with height $H$ and radius $R$ so that its vertex is at
the centre of the base of the larger cone. Find $h$ in terms of the
dimensions of the larger cone that makes the volume of the smaller
cone maximal.

{\aufgabe} For a fish swimming at a speed $v$ relative to the water,
the energy expenditure per unit time is proportional to $v^{3}$. It is
believed that migrating fish try to minimize the total energy required
to swim a fixed distance. If the fish are swimming against a current
$u$ ($u<v$), then the time required to swim a distance $L$ is
$L/(v-u)$ and the total energy $E$ required to swim the distance is
given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:aiyeiyoo}
  E(v)=av^{3}\cdot\frac{L}{v-u}
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the proportionality constant. Determine the value of $v$
that minimizes $E$.

{\aufgabe} How close does the semi-circle $y=\sqrt{16-x^{2}}$ come to
the point $P=(1,\sqrt{3})$?
