  \frametitle{Rate of Change}
If $f(t)$ expresses some type of position of something dependent on
time $t$, then the rate of change over an interval is the slope of the
secant line. The derivative $f'(t)$ is then the instantaneous rate of
change or the slope of the tangent line at $t$. 

\bigskip

Sometimes the rate of change is not with respect to a position. For
example, acceleration is the rate of change with respect to a
velocity. Another common example is the rate of change in numbers of a
population. In economics, the rate of change in pricing may be of
interest.

Define $f(t)=5t+3t^{2}$. The derivative is $v(t)=f'(t)=5+6t$. Locate
the time at which $v(t)=5$ by solving the equation $5=5+6t$. The
initial time is $t=0$. Then
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:airaiwie}
  v(2)=f'(2)=5+6\cdot{}2=17
\end{equation}
The velocity after 2 seconds is 17m/s.

Newton's Law of Gravitation says that the magnitude $F$ of the force
exerted by a body of mass $m$ on a body of mass $M$ is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:zeipouqu}
  F=\frac{GmM}{r^{2}}
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $r$ is the distance
between the bodies. Suppose it is known that the Earth attracts an
object with a force that decreases at the rate of 2N/km when
$r=20,000$km (N=kg$\cdot$m/s$^{2}$). What is the mass of the object?
Assume the following as constants:
% \begin{tabular}{|l|rcl|}\hline
%   gravitational constant & $G$&=&$6.67408\cdot{}10^{−11}\mbox{m}^{3}\mbox{kg}^{−1}\mbox{s}^{−2}$ \\ \hline
%   mass of the Earth & $m$&=&$5.9722\cdot{}10^{24}\mbox{kg}$ \\ \hline
% \end{tabular}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phosulee}
  % G=6.67408\cdot{}10^{−11}\mbox{m}^{3}\mbox{kg}^{−1}\mbox{s}^{−2}
  G=6.67408\cdot{}10^{-11}m^{3}kg^{-1}s^{-2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}

The number of yeast cells in a laboratory culture increases rapidly
initially but levels off eventually. The population is modeled by the
function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:kupeivae}
  n=f(t)=\frac{a}{1+be^{-0.7t}}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is measured in hours. At time $t=0$ the population is 20
cells and is increasing at a rate of 12 cells per hour. Find the
values of $a$ and $b$. According to this model, what happens to the
yeast population in the long run?

  Find the rate of change for the population by differentiating,

    \label{eq:mohvuthe}
    f'(t)=\frac{0.7ab\cdot{}e^{-0.7t}}{\left(1+be^{-0.7t}\right)^{2}}

  Find $a$ in terms of $b$ using the equation $f(0)=20$.
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:deesaiye}
    a=20\cdot(1+b)
  \end{equation}
  Find $b$ using $a=20\cdot(1+b)$ and the equation $f'(0)=12$
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:oozeeroj}
    12=\frac{0.7\cdot{}20\cdot(1+b)}{(1+b)^{2}}\hspace{.5in}\Rightarrow\hspace{.5in}b=\frac{1}{6}

The cost, in dollars, of producing $x$ yards of a certain fabric is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:uquuthae}
  C(x)=1200+12x-0.1x^{2}+0.0005x^{3}
\end{equation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the marginal cost function.
\item Find $C'(200)$ and explain its meaning. What does it
  predict?
\item Compare $C'(200)$ with the cost of manufacturing the 201st
  yard of fabric.
\end{enumerate}

  Differentiate for the marginal cost function,
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:zingohlu}
    C'(x)=12-0.2x+0.0015x^{2}
  \end{equation}
Therefore, $C'(200)=32$. At 200 yards, the cost of producing yards is
\$32 per yard. The cost of manufacturing the 201st
yard of fabric is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:goozahsu}
  C(201)-C(200)=3632.2-3600=32.2

  \frametitle{Exponential Growth and Decay I}
  Growth often happens proportional to size. For example, a population
  of 500 will grow to 550 during a given period of time while at the
  same growth rate a population of 1000 will grow to 1100 during the
  same period of time. Interest on a bank account is another example.
  Radioactive decay is an example for decay, sometimes also called
  negative growth. 

\bigskip

The growth rate $f'(t)$ should be proportional to the population
$f(t)$, so $f'(t)=kf(t)$, where $k$ is some constant. We already know
that the function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sohngiel}
  f(t)=Ce^{kt}
\end{equation}
fulfills this constraint. It turns out that the function in
(\ref{eq:sohngiel}) is the only function fulfilling this constraint.
Calculate $C$ in terms of $f$.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Exponential Growth and Decay II}
Many natural phenomena have been found to follow the law that an
amount $f(t)$ varies with time $t$ according to
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lauwutho}
    f(t)=f(0)e^{kt}
  \end{equation}
If $k>0$, there is growth. If $k<0$, there is decay.

A colony of bacteria grows according to the law of uninhibited growth
according to the function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:chiowezo}
  N(t)=100e^{0.045t}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is measured in grams and $t$ is measured in days.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the initial amount of bacteria.
  \item What is the growth rate of the bacteria?
  \item What is the population after five days?
  \item How long will it take for the population to reach 140
    grams?
  \item What is the doubling time for the population?

  \frametitle{Radiocarbon Dating}
Radiocarbon dating is a method archeologists use to determine the age
of ancient objects. The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere always
contains a fixed fraction of radioactive carbon, carbon-14 ($^{14}$C),
with a half-life of about 5730 years. Plants absorb carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere, which then makes its way to animals through the
food chain. Thus, all living creatures contain the same fixed
proportions of $^{14}$C to nonradioactive $^{12}$C as the atmosphere.

\medskip

After an organism dies, it stops assimilating $^{14}$C, and the amount
of $^{14}$C in it begins to decay exponentially. We can then determine
the time elapsed since the death of the organism by measuring the
amount of $^{14}$C left in it.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Radiocarbon Dating Example}
If a donkey bone contains 73\% as much $^{14}$C as a living donkey,
when did it die?

\medskip

Look at the following table to notice the pattern,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sayeeziu}
  \begin{array}{rcccl}
        100\% & \ldots & 2^{-0} & \ldots & 5730\cdot{}0 \\
        50\% & \ldots & 2^{-1} & \ldots & 5730\cdot{}1 \\
        25\% & \ldots & 2^{-2} & \ldots & 5730\cdot{}2
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
Therefore ($t$ being the number of years ago that the donkey died),
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:anuvuama}
  t=\left(-\log_{2}0.73\right)\cdot{}5730=-\frac{\ln{}0.73}{\ln{}2}\cdot{}5730\approx{}2600
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Radiocarbon Dating Exercise}
  $^{14}C$ dating assumes that the carbon dioxid on earth today has
  the same radioactive content as it did centuries ago. If this is
  true, then amount of $^{14}C$ absorbed by a tree that grew several
  centuries ago should be the same as the amount of $^{14}C$ absorbed
  by a similar tree growing today. A piece of acient charcoal contains
  only 15\% as much of the radioactive carbon as a piece of modern
  charcoal. How long ago was the tree burned to make the ancient
  charcoal? (The half-life of $^{14}C$ is 5730 years.)
